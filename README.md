# predicting dumbbell exercise

## Introduction

Often people quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify *how well they do it*. The goal of this project is to predict the manner participants did the exercise using data from accelometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbell of 6 participants.

## Overview of the data

The data used for prediction is available from the website here: [ http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har]( http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har ). For this study, the data was downloaded on 28 May 2020.

The measured workout was performed by six male participants who  were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions:

1. exactly according to the specification (Class A)
2. throwing the elbows to the front (Class B)
3. lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C)
4. lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D)
5. throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

The data consists of 19,622 observations in 160 variables. There are total 158 features, as variable 'classe' is the manner of exercise to predicted and 'X' is an index column.
